Case Study III

Domain –Telecom

Focus – Optimization

Business challenge/requirement:
LifeTel Telecomis the latest entrant in the highly competitive Telecom market of Singapore. It issues SIM to the verified users. 
Till now verification was manual through the photocopy of approved id card document. However,government has recently introduced
Social ID called Reference ID which is mapped to fingerprint of user.LifeTel should now verify user against the fingerprint and
Reference ID

Key issues:
Build a system where when user enters Reference ID it is encrypted, so that hackers cannot view the mapping of Reference ID and
finger print.

Considerations: System should be secure

Data volume: NA

Additional information: NA

Business benefits:
Company will be able to quickly issue SIM to user and expected gain in volume is approximately 10 times as the manual process
of verification is replaced with secure automated system

Approach to Solve:
You have to use fundamentals of Python taught in module 1
1. Read the input from command line –Reference ID
2. Check for validity –it should be 12 digits and allows on number andalphabet
3. Encrypt the Reference ID and print it for reference

Enhancements for code:
You can try these enhancements in code
1.Allow some special characters in ReferenceID
2.Give the option for decryption to user
