Case Study II

1. What is the output of the following code?
   nums = set([1,1,2,3,3,3,4,4])
   print(len(nums))
   Hint: Set consists unique element.

2. What will be the output?
      d = {"john":40, "peter":45}
      print(list(d.keys()))
   Hint: d.keys() is the function which will show keys.

3. A website requires a user to input username and password to register. Write a program
   to check the validity of password given by user. Following are the criteria for checking password:
      1. At least 1 letter between [a-z]
      2. At least 1 number between [0-9]
      1. At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
      3. At least 1 character from [$#@]
      4. Minimum length of transaction password: 6
      5. Maximum length of transaction password: 12

   Hint: In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

4. Write a for loop that prints all elements of a list and their position in the list.
   a = [4,7,3,2,5,9]
   Hint: Use Loop to iterate through list elements.

5. Please write a program which accepts a string from console and print the characters that have even indexes.
   Example: If the following string is given as input to the program: H1e2l3l4o5w6o7r8l9d
   Then, the output of the program should be: Helloworld
   
6. Please write a program which accepts a string from console and print it in reverse order.
   Example: If the following string is given as input to the program:  rise to vote sir
   Then, the output of the program should be: ris etov ot esir

7. Please write a program which count and print the numbers of each character in a string input by console.
   Example: If the following string is given as input to the program:  abcdefgabc
   Then, the output of the program should be:
      a,2
      c,2
      b,2
      e,1
      d,1
      g,1
      f,1

8. With two given lists [1,3,6,78,35,55] and [12,24,35,24,88,120,155], write a program to make a list whose elements are
   intersection of the above given lists.

9. By using list comprehension, please write a program to print the list after removing the value 24 in [12,24,35,24,88,120,155].

10. By using list comprehension, please write a program to print the list after removing
    the 0th,4th,5th numbers in [12,24,35,70,88,120,155].

11. By using list comprehension, please write a program to print the list after removing
    delete numbers which are divisible by 5 and 7 in [12,24,35,70,88,120,155].

12. Write a program to compute 1/2+2/3+3/4+...+n/n+1 with a given n input by console (n>0).
    Example: If the following n is given as input to the program: 5
    Then, the output of the program should be: 3.55
